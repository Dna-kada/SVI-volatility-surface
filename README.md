<h3> SVI volatility Surface</h3>
This respository is a personal project demonstrating the modelling of an SVI volatility surface currently for the AMZN options. It is in working progress os there will be a number of improvements over time.  

The 3D volatility surface may be viewed easily in html if the relevant file is downloaded.

There are a range of functions in quantlib Python that may be used in place of functions I have inserted myself but the goal for this notebook so far is demonstration, not optimisation.
